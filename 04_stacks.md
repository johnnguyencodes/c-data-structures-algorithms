### **Stacks: Key Concepts and Operations**

- **Definition:** A stack is a common data structure that supports three main operations:
  1. **Push:** Add an element to the end (top) of the stack.
  2. **Pop:** Remove an element from the end (top) of the stack.
  3. **Peek:** Look at the last element in the stack without removing it.

- **Efficiency:** 
  - All three operations (push, pop, peek) should run in constant time (`O(1)`).
  
- **Implementation:**
  - Stacks can be implemented using dynamic arrays, which naturally support these operations efficiently.
  - In most programming languages, stacks are often implemented using the default dynamic array data structure.

### **Understanding Stack Operations with Dynamic Arrays**

- **Push Operation:**
  - You can push elements onto a stack sequentially.
  - Conceptually, stacks are often visualized vertically, where pushing adds elements to the "top" of the stack.
  - In practice, pushing a new element moves it to the next empty position in the array.

- **Pop Operation:**
  - Popping an element removes it from the top (end) of the stack.
  - Internally, the array doesn’t actually delete the element but rather adjusts the pointer or index that tracks the "top" of the stack.
  - The removed element is simply ignored in future operations.

- **Order of Operations:**
  - Stacks follow a **Last-In, First-Out (LIFO)** order:
    - The last element pushed onto the stack is the first one to be popped off.
    - The second-to-last element is the second to be popped off, and so on.

### **Use Cases of Stacks**

- **Reversing a Sequence:**
  - One of the simplest and most intuitive use cases of a stack is to reverse a sequence of elements.
  - For example, if you push a sequence of numbers or characters onto a stack, popping them off will yield the sequence in reverse order.

- **Other Use Cases:**
  - Stacks have many other applications, often used in scenarios that require reversing operations or backtracking.
  - Examples include parsing expressions, undo functionality in applications, and depth-first search algorithms in graph theory.

- **Practice:**
  - It’s beneficial to practice using stacks through coding problems that involve this data structure, as it will help solidify your understanding of its behavior and use cases.
