### **Static Arrays - Key Concepts**

- **Properties of Arrays:**
  - An array is a contiguous block of data stored in RAM.
  - The two most common operations on arrays are reading and writing data.

- **Reading from an Array:**
  - **Accessing Elements:**
    - The first element is accessed at index `0`.
    - Subsequent elements are accessed at increasing indices (e.g., index `1`, `2`, etc.).
  - **Efficiency:**
    - Accessing any element in an array is an efficient operation, known as **O(1) time complexity** (constant time).
    - This efficiency is due to RAM's property of random access, allowing direct access to any memory location.

- **Writing to an Array:**
  - **Fixed Size:**
    - Static arrays are of fixed size, meaning the size of the array is set at the time of declaration and cannot be changed.
  - **Adding and Removing Elements:**
    - Adding a new element to the end of the array is an O(1) operation, provided there is space.
    - Removing an element typically involves overwriting it (e.g., setting it to `0` or `-1`), but the memory remains allocated.
  - **Inserting Elements:**
    - Inserting at the end of an array is efficient (O(1)), assuming there is space.
    - Inserting in the middle or at the beginning requires shifting elements, making it an O(n) operation in the worst case, where `n` is the number of elements in the array.
  - **Removing Elements:**
    - Removing an element from the middle of the array also requires shifting elements to fill the gap, leading to O(n) time complexity.

- **Static Arrays vs. Dynamic Arrays:**
  - Static arrays have a fixed size and do not allow for resizing.
  - Dynamic arrays (common in languages like Python and JavaScript) can grow or shrink as needed, avoiding some of the limitations of static arrays.

- **Worst-Case Scenarios:**
  - In the worst case, inserting or removing elements from the middle of the array requires shifting all subsequent elements, resulting in O(n) time complexity.

- **Summary of Operations:**
  - **O(1) Operations:**
    - Reading or writing any arbitrary element.
    - Inserting or removing an element at the end of the array.
  - **O(n) Operations (Worst Case):**
    - Inserting or removing an element in the middle or at the beginning of the array, requiring the shifting of elements.

These notes summarize the key points about static arrays, focusing on their properties, the efficiency of various operations, and the limitations that arise from their fixed size.
